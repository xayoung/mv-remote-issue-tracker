# Privacy Policy for MV Remote

**Last Updated: January 27, 2026**

This Privacy Policy explains how MV Remote ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### 1.1. Local Network Data
MV Remote operates primarily by connecting directly to a local instance of MultiViewer running on your local network. The IP address and Port number you enter are used solely to establish this direct connection.
- **Data Storage**: Your connection details (IP address and Port) are stored locally on your device using `AsyncStorage` to provide a convenient user experience.
- **Data Transmission**: This data is **not** transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers. All control commands and telemetry data flow directly between your mobile device and your local computer.

### 1.2. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions

#### MV Remote Pro Subscription
We offer the following subscription options for MV Remote Pro:

| Plan | Price | Duration |
|------|-------|----------|
| Quarterly | $0.99 USD | 3 months (auto-renewable) |
| Annual | $2.99 USD | 12 months (auto-renewable) |
| Lifetime | $9.99 USD | One-time purchase |

- **Auto-Renewal**: Quarterly and Annual subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
- **Payment**: Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.
- **Cancellation**: You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your App Store account settings.

#### Third-Party Service (RevenueCat)
We use a third-party service, **RevenueCat**, to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions.
- **Data Shared**: When you make a purchase, RevenueCat may collect and process information regarding your purchase history and subscription status. This may include an anonymous App User ID to sync purchases across devices.
- **Privacy Policy**: Use of RevenueCat is subject to their privacy policy, which can be found at: [https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

### 1.3. Personal Information
We do not knowingly collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or location data.

## 2. Data Security
We prioritize the security of your data.
- **Local Storage**: Your custom settings (IP/Port) are stored in your device's secure local storage.
- **Direct Connection**: Communication happens entirely within your local network (LAN), reducing the risk of external interception.

## 3. Children's Privacy
Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page or within the App. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
